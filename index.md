# Introduction to MARL

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an extension of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that deals with multiple agents learning to interact in a shared environment [1]. Here's an overview of MARL:

1. **Primer on normal RL**: 
   - RL involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
   - The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize cumulative rewards [2].

2. **Why do we need MARL?**: 
   - Real-world scenarios often involve multiple decision-makers or agents.
   - MARL allows for modeling complex interactions and dependencies between agents [3].

3. **What necessitates MARL?**: 
   - Scenarios with multiple autonomous entities (e.g., robotics, game theory, traffic control).
   - Problems where decentralized decision-making is crucial [4].

4. **How does MARL distinguish itself from traditional RL?**: 
   - Multiple agents learning simultaneously.
   - Non-stationary environments due to changing behaviors of other agents.
   - Potential for cooperation, competition, or mixed scenarios [5].
